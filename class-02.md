## Reasons test driven development are important
* Better Program Design and Higher Quality Code
* Detailed Product Documentation
* Reduces the Time for Project Development
## Downside of Test Driven Development
* It feels like it takes a long time
## Difference between ES6 Classes and Constructor classes
* ES6 allows the developers to instantiate objects using the new operator. ES5 Constructors focus on how the objects are instantiated.
## When to use static method?
* When you dont want to create an object to call a method in your code.

## Functional Programming
* A programming paradigm for developing software using functions.
## Pure Function
* Given the same input, will always return the same output. Produces no side effects.
## Higher-Order Function
* takes one or more functions as arguments. OR returns a function as its result.
## Immutable State
* State that can't be mutated.
## Object
* An unordered Collecton of Data
## OOP
* A programming paradigm based on the concept of "objects", which can contain data, in the form of fields (often known as attributes or properties), and code, in the form of procedures (often known as methods).
## Class
* Type of function.
## Prototype
* Prototypes are the mechanism by which JavaScript objects inherit features from one another.
