# First thing!
* You need to properly allocate time when solving coding problems.  Preparation before action is more important than blind action.  Understanding what you are going to do before you begin doing it will help you execute efficiently.
## Recommended steps
### Read the problem completely twice.
* You want to make sure you completely understand the problem.  A good test of this is whether or not you can explain the problem to someone else.
### Solve the problem manually with 3 sets of sample data.
* It is very important to solve the problem manually first, so that you know what you are going to automate, otherwise you are just slinging code around.  Which while can be fun, will make you look like an idiot in a programming interview and will probably cause you to sweat profusely.
### Optimize the manual steps.
* It is much easier to rearrange and reconstruct and idea or algorithm in your head than it is in code. Itâ€™s well worth the effort to try and optimize the actual solution or simplify it when it is still in the most easily malleable state.
### Write the manual steps as comments or pseudo-code.
* What we want to do here is capture all the steps we created and now either put them into our editor as comments or write them as psuedo-code that we can translate to real code.
### Replace the comments or pseudo-code with real code.
### Optimize the real code.
* This is also a good place to make sure all your variables are named with long meaningful names.  I cannot stress enough how important having good names for your variables and methods is for helping the person evaluating your code to understand what you were trying to do.  This is especially important when you make a mistake.
# 5 Whys and 5 Hows
* The five whys and five hows techniques constitute a questioning process designed to drill down into the details of a problem or a solution and peel away the layers of symptoms. The technique was originally developed by Sakichi Toyoda who stated that "by repeating why five times, the nature of the problem as well as its solution becomes clear."

* The five whys are used for drilling down into a problem and the five hows are used to develop the details of a solution to a problem. Both are designed to bring clarity and refinement to a problem statement or a potential solution and get to the root cause or root solution.
